# toki suno

**toki suno** is a light-based realisation of **toki pona**, designed for intelligences that do not use speech or humanoid gestures, but can control coloured light.

It was created as part of a science-fiction project, but is documented here as a standalone language design experiment.

## What it is

toki suno expresses toki pona concepts using:
- colour
- spatial arrangement
- framing

A full utterance can be shown **simultaneously**, rather than word by word.  
Grammatical roles are indicated visually (for example, by borders), rather than by particles or word order.

The result is a system that is:
- more limited in vocabulary than toki pona
- but capable of faster, denser expression if the medium allows it

---

## Why light
        
The language is intended for communication with non-humanoid intelligences whose physical form or sensory systems differ from humans, where:
- speech is not available
- limbs or signing are not possible
- light is a shared, controllable medium

Design choices prioritise:
- simplicity
- immediacy
- minimal social assumptions

Concepts that depend on human social structures (such as money or gender) are intentionally excluded.

## Relation to toki pona

Toki Suno is **inspired by toki pona** and follows its philosophy of minimalism and context-driven meaning, where differing perspectives can lead to multiple valid interpretations.

It does not add grammatical categories to toki pona.  
Instead, it removes or compresses them by using a visual modality.

The aim is not to replace toki pona, but to explore how its ideas behave when:
- linear order is removed
- grammar becomes spatial
- meaning is perceived all at once

---

## Design constraints

- Extremely small vocabulary
- No reliance on word order
- No grammatical gender
- No required connectors or particles
- Meaning derived from colour, position, and framing
- Ambiguity is accepted as a feature, not a flaw

---

## Status

This is an **experimental design**.

The rules, terminology, and examples may change.  
Feedback on structure and clarity is welcome.
